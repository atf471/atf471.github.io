		<p> <h1 style="color:cyan;"><center> My name is Angela! </center> </h1>> </p>
		<p><center> I'm spending my days in Adobe with a program called Girls Who Code!</center> </p>
		<p> This is <em> super </em> exciting, as I have <em> never </em> in my life taken a serious coding class. </p>
		<p> Rather, I've only taken the casual coding online course- all of which I have <b>never </b>finished in my life. </p>
		<p> This is all rather new for me </p>
		<p> Recently I've visited the <em> loml: school addition </em> , aka the University of Pennsylvania. I will leave you all with a quotes from their founder and one of our founding fathers, <b> Ben Franklin </b> 
		<blockquote> 
		<em> Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn. </em>
		</blockquote>
